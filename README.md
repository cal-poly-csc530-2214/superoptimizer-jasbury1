# Super Optimizer (jasbury1)

Experimented with Jeremy Berchtold's version of GPU optimized
branch-free instructions:

I want to start experimenting with  building a GPU instruction version of Aha!
But that will be a project for another day...
As a side note, it looks like NVIDIA does not publish their instructions,
but AMD does as part of their "GPU open compute" initiative:
